Food at HwealthCafe:
 

HwealthCafe foodThe Choco shake was a yummy treat. The saute meal platter was delicious, a portion of mixed vegetable brown rice with a peanut based mushroom curry on the side was out of the world. The concept of the place was kept in mind while the food is prepared. No maida or mayo is there to spoil your calorie count. If you have a sour throat the Spicy citrus tea work its magic.

Ordered a low-calorie fresh fruit dessert which was yoghurt base with layers of fruits & carrot.
